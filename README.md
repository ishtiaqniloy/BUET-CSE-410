# CSE_410_Assignment1_Wheel
In this assignment a movable wheel will be implemented using OpenGL.

Specifications:

Wheel (2.exe)

w - move forward
s - move backward
a - rotate left
d - rotate right

Use arrow keys to move the camera.
Keep in mind that a full (360 degree) rotation of the wheel moves the wheel linearly by a length equal to the perimeter of the wheel.
It is not required to strictly imitate the color patterns, but the shape of the wheel must be discernible.
For Camera, use the 2nd out of the three gluLookAt statements (Line 291) in the demo code.
